# ðŸŒ² Forest Cover Type Classification

## ðŸ“Œ Description
This project predicts the **forest cover type** based on cartographic and environmental features.  
It uses the **UCI Covertype dataset**, which contains 581,012 samples and 54 features.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## ðŸ“Š Steps
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing (scaling + categorical handling).
2. Train multi-class classifier (XGBoost).
3. Evaluate model using accuracy, classification report & confusion matrix.
4. Visualize feature importance.

## âœ… Results
- Multi-class classification with **XGBoost**.
- Confusion matrix shows class distribution of predictions.
- Feature importance highlights top environmental predictors of forest type.
